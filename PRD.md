# Bank Statement to CSV Converter - PRD

## Overview
The Bank Statement to CSV Converter is a web application that allows users to upload bank statement PDF documents, automatically extract transaction data using AI, and export the data to CSV format for further analysis or import into financial software.

## Problem Statement
Many users need to track their finances using tools like Excel, budgeting apps, or accounting software, but manually copying transaction data from bank statements is time-consuming and error-prone. Different banks use different statement formats, making it difficult to create a one-size-fits-all extraction tool.

## Product Vision
Create an intuitive web application that can intelligently extract transaction data from various bank statement formats using AI, saving users time and reducing data entry errors.

## Target Users
- Individual users who want to track personal finances
- Small business owners who need to import transactions into accounting software
- Accountants who process client bank statements
- Financial analysts who need to analyze transaction data

## User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to upload my bank statement, so I can extract transaction data without manual copying.
2. **As a user**, I want to preview extracted data before downloading, so I can verify accuracy.
3. **As a user**, I want to download transaction data as CSV, so I can import it into my financial software.
4. **As a user**, I want the application to work with different bank statement formats, so I don't need multiple tools.
5. **As a user**, I want the extraction process to be quick and accurate, so I can save time.
6. **As a user**, I want a simple, intuitive interface, so I can use the tool without technical expertise.
